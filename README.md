# Regression_HousePrice


The goal of the project was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately predict house prices based on various features, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant factors. The project aimed to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions by providing them with reliable and accurate price estimates for houses.
